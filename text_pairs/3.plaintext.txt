but though i was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg i was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him there were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked old wild seasongs minding nobody but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing often i have heard the house shaking with yohoho and a bottle of rum all the neighbours joining in for dear life with the fear of death upon them and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark for in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question or sometimes because none was put and so he judged the company was not following his story nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed his stories were what frightened people worst of all dreadful stories they were about hanging and walking the plank and storms at sea and the dry tortugas and wild deeds and places on the spanish main by his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that god ever allowed upon the sea and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described my father was always saying the inn would be ruined for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down and sent shivering to their beds but i really believe his presence did us good people were frightened at the time but on looking back they rather liked it it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him calling him a true seadog and a real old salt and such like names and saying there was the sort of man that made england terrible at sea in one way indeed he bade fair to ruin us for he kept on staying week after week and at last month after month so that all the money had been long exhausted and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more if ever he mentioned it the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared and stared my poor father out of the room i have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff and i am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death all the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker one of the cocks of his hat having fallen down he let it hang from that day forth though it was a great annoyance when it blew i remember the appearance of his coat which he patched himself upstairs in his room and which before the end was nothing but patches he never wrote or received a letter and he never spoke with any but the neighbours and with these for the most part only when drunk on rum the great seachest none of us had ever seen open
