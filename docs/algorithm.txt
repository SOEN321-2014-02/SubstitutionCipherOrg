I translate it into English steps as
i) Import an English language frequency matrix (26 char plus space)

ii) Create a guess key matrix called k 
  - (OPTIONAL) create the guess by:
   - calculating the single character frequency matrix for the ciphertext
   - comparing English single character matrix to ciphertext single character matrix 

iii) Calculate the Digram frequency matrix for the decrypted ciphertext

iv) Perform a matrix addition function on the ciphertext Digram frequency matrix  and the English Digram frequency matrix and assign result to v

v) take the guess key k and copy it to a second variable called k'

vi) take the ciphertext Digram frequency matrix called D and copy it to a new variable called D'

vii) Use the swapping algorithm to swap two element in the guess key k' 

viii) swap rows and columns in D' (it says corresponding but I'm not clear on what we are corresponding with?)

ix)  Perform a matrix addition function on the D' ciphertext Digram frequency matrix and the English Digram frequency matrix and assign result to v'

x) Compare v' and v' and go back to step v) if v' is greater or equal to v, if v' is less than v continue to step xi)

xi) assigned v' to v

xii) assign k' to k

xiii) assign D' to D

xiv) go back to step vii) and perform the swap again
